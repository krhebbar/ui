Connections are a way to authenticate with external services. They're defined in the snap-in manifest under the `keyrings` section.

The developer can specify a list of keyrings that the snap-in requires. The installer is asked to provide the connection when installing the snap-in.

For example, to require the installer to provide either a GitHub PAT or GitHub OAuth when installing the snap-in, the following can be specified in the manifest:

```yaml
keyrings:
  - name: github
    description: GitHub Auth
    types:
      - devrev-github-oauth
      - devrev-github-pat
    display_name: GitHub Connection
```

In the above YAML, the `name` specifies a unique identifier for the connection in the snap-in.
The `description` is a human readable description of the connection shown to the user at the time of snap-in installation.
The `types` field specifies the list of possible connection types that the user can provide.
The `display_name` is the name that's shown to the user when they are asked to provide a connection.

The following connection types are currently supported, where the Identifier field is the value to be specified in the `types` field of the connection in the manifest:

| Connection Name              | Identifier                    | AppName             | Description                                        |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| DevRev PAT                   | devrev-pat                    | devrev              | Authenticate with DevRev using PAT                 |
| DevRev Snap-in Secret        | devrev-snap-in-secret         | generic             | Store a generic secret string                      |
