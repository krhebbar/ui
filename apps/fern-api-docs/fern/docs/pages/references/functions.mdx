Using functions, you can provide custom code and link it to your event sources, automations, or snap-kit actions. Functions are written in JavaScript and can be used to transform events, send notifications, or perform any other custom logic including network calls.

In order to create a snap-in version, functions must be defined as shown in the [code samples](/snapin-development/code-samples). Functions are packaged and provided as an artifact at the time of snap-in version creation and then used to deploy functions to snap-in versions. An artifact may contain multiple function definitions. The artifact is a zip file containing the following files:


```bash
/
├── src/
├ ├── functions/ # Contains a folder each for the functions defined in the manifest. The folder name should match the function name in manifest.
├ ├── functions/function-1/ # function-1 is a function defined in the manifest.
├ ├── function-factory.ts # defines the functions to be imported. Each function to be used in the manifest should be included here. Refer to the example for the format.
├── dist/ # Contains the transpiled code for the functions. Autogenerated but should be included in the artifact.
├── package.json # Contains the dependencies for the functions.

```

## Function manifest

The function manifest consists of the following fields:

```yaml
functions:
  - name: function_1
    description: Function 1
```

- `name`: It is the function name that should match the corresponding function name in the folder.
- `description`: It describes the function.


<Callout intent="note">
Each function should be registered in `src/function-factory.ts` to be available for execution.
</Callout>

Refer to the [function invocation](/snapin-development/references/function-invocation) for details about the exact payload of the function.
