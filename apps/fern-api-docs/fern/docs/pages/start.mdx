In this tutorial, you'll learn to create and deploy a snap-in. Additionally, you'll learn to create a snap-in version, installing from a version, deploying, deleting and upgrading the snap-in.

Snap-ins are collections of objects that extend DevRev's core platform value. These objects include automation, event sources, keyrings, custom types, and vistas. Snap-ins are packaged and installed separately from the DevRev core platform. To create your own snap-in, create a [dev org](https://app.devrev.ai/) where you will be installing your snap-in.

<Steps>

### Before you begin

- Install [DevRev CLI](/snapin-development/references/cli-install)
- Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq)

### Log in to DevRev for authentication

To authenticate, run the following command:

```bash
devrev profiles authenticate -o <dev-org-slug> -u <youremail@yourdomain.com>
```

### Initialize a snap-in template

To initialize a snap-in template, run the following command:

```bash
devrev snap_in_version init
```
After the command runs, a new folder `devrev-snaps-typescript-template` is
created in the filesystem.

```
devrev-snaps-typescript-template/
├── code
│   ├── babel.config.js
│   ├── jest.config.js
│   ├── nodemon.json
│   ├── package.json
│   ├── src
│   │   ├── fixtures
│   │   │   └── on_work_created_event.json
│   │   ├── function-factory.ts
│   │   ├── functions
│   │   │   └── on_work_creation
│   │   │       ├── index.test.ts
│   │   │       └── index.ts
│   │   ├── index.ts
│   │   ├── main.ts
│   │   └── test-runner
│   │       ├── example.test.ts
│   │       └── test-runner.ts
│   ├── tsconfig.eslint.json
│   └── tsconfig.json
├── manifest.yaml
└── README.md
```

The command creates a folder `devrev-snaps-typescript-template`. This contains a `manifest.yaml` file and a `code` folder.

- `manifest` file defines the resources to be created on the DevRev platform. For detailed information on the various components of a manifest file, see [Snap-in Manifest](/snapin-development/references/manifest).
- `code` folder consists of sample starter code for snap-ins. For detailed information on how to get started, see [starter example repo](https://github.com/devrev/snap-in-examples/tree/main/1-starter/code#readme).

### Create a snap-in package

To create a [snap-in package](/snapin-development/concepts), run the following command:

```bash
devrev snap_in_package create-one --slug my-first-snap-in | jq .
```
<Callout intent="note">
1. The slug is globally unique. If the slug provided is already taken, a conflict error occurs. This can be resolved by provided a different slug.
2. On successful creation, the CLI automatically stores the package ID in its context corresponding to the slug. For more information, refer to the [Snap-in Context](/snapin-development/references/cli#snap-in-context).
</Callout>

### Create a snap-in version

To create a [snap-in version](/snapin-development/references/cli#snap-in-version), run the following command:

```bash
devrev snap_in_version create-one --path ./devrev-snaps-typescript-template
```

Output:

```json
{
    "id":"don:integration:dvrv-us-1:devo/fOFb0IdZ:snap_in_package/972696ef-32cf-4ec0-81da-5a4a7804fa91:snap_in_version/52c058a9-7d68-4538-b70e-46efc7dfcd0d",
    ...... ,
    "state":"draft"
}
```
<Callout intent="info">
 The CLI automatically stores the version ID in its context. Refer to the [Snap-in Context](/snapin-development/references/cli#snap-in-context) section for more information.
</Callout>

In a package that's not published to the marketplace, you can have only one snap-in version. If you have an existing snap-in version in the package, the following error message is shown:

```json
{
  "debug_message": "can't create a new snap_in_version under snap_in_package <ID> because there is already a non-published snap_in_version under it",
  "message": "Bad Request",
  "type": "bad_request"
}
```

To list snap-in versions under the package, run the following command:

```bash
devrev snap_in_version list
```

To delete the snap-in version, run the following command:

```bash
devrev snap_in_version delete-one
```

### Install a snap-in from a snap-in version

To create a snap-in from a snap-in version, run the following command:

```bash
devrev snap_in draft
```

<Callout intent="note">
1. To install the snap-in, you must be a member of the **Admins** group in the dev org.
2. If you get a `snap-in version is not ready` error, check the version state with `devrev snap_in_version show`. The state should be `ready` for installation. If `build_failed`, check the logs for errors.
</Callout>

<br />

<Callout intent="info">
The CLI automatically stores the snap-in ID in its context. Refer to the [Snap-in Context](/snapin-development/references/cli#snap-in-context) section for more information.
</Callout>

### Configure the snap-in

The snap-in is installed in draft state. It may require some configuration before it can be deployed.

You can access snap-in configuration by using the URL generated by the draft command, or by navigating to the snap-ins page in the DevRev app.

Follow the configuration steps for the snap-in to setup keyrings and inputs if any.

<Callout intent="info">
Private keyrings from other creators aren't listed.
</Callout>

To make a connection available to other members in your organization, create it with the **visible to dev org** option set to true while creating the connection in the DevRev app.

### Deploy the snap-in

Once you have provided the required configuration, the **Deploy snap-in** button is enabled on the UI. Click on it to deploy the snap-in.
That's it, the snap-in should now be active and ready to use.

### Check snap-in logs

To check the logs for the snap-in, run the following command:

```bash
devrev snap_in_package logs | jq
```

### Delete the snap-in

The snap-in can be deleted from the UI or run the following command:

```bash
devrev snap_in delete-one [snap-in id]
```

If any deactivate hook is specified, it's invoked with `is_deletion=true`.

### Upgrade the snap-in

Once you deploy and test your snap-in, you may want to make changes to it. The changes can be done using a single command.

```bash
devrev snap_in_version upgrade --path ./
```

The above expects the manifest file to be present in the current directory by the name `manifest.yaml` and the code to be present in the `code` directory.

Refer to [upgrade command](/snapin-development/upgrade-snap-ins) for more information.
