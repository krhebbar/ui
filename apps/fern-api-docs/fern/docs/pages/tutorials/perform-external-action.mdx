If you did not follow the [getting started](/snapin-development/tutorials/getting-started) tutorial then follow these steps to authenticate and initialize the snap-in TypeScript template:

```bash
devrev profiles authenticate -o <dev-org-slug> -u <youremail@yourdomain.com>
```

```bash
devrev snap_in_version init
```
</Callout>

#### Trigger

To initiate the process of creating a GitHub issue directly from a DevRev issue, a trigger mechanism is essential. In this context, the implementation involves the introduction of a specialized command. This command is designed to be executed exclusively from the discussion section of a DevRev issue, serving as the catalyst for replicating the issue on GitHub.

#### Action

The primary action involves leveraging the issue creation API provided by GitHub. This API is utilized to create the GitHub issue seamlessly from the corresponding issue in DevRev.

### Creating the snap-in

#### Updating the manifest

To outline the structure of the snap-in, the initial step is to define key attributes in the snap-in's manifest. Begin by specifying the name, description, and account display name for the snap-in.

```yml
version: "2"
name: "GitHub issue creator"
description: "Replicate DevRev issues in GitHub."

service_account:
  display_name: GitHub Issue Creator
```

### Keyrings

To facilitate authentication for our API calls, the initial step involves creating a Personal Access Token (PAT) in GitHub. This PAT can be stored as a [connection](/snapin-development/references/keyrings) within DevRev. Subsequently, this
connection is employed within our snap-in in the form of keyrings.

```yml
keyrings:
  organization:
    - name: github_connection
      display_name: Github Connection
      description: Github PAT
      types:
        - snap_in_secret
```

### Functions and commands

Having established the foundational configurations, the subsequent step is to define the functions and commands responsible for orchestrating the core logic of the snap-in.

```yaml
functions:
  - name: command_handler
    description: Function to create a GitHub issue
```

The command states where you can use it. For example, in the **Discussions** tab of issues.

It also explains the different situations and ways in which you can make use of this command.

```yml
commands:
  - name: gh_issue
    namespace: devrev
    description: Command to create a GitHub issue.
    surfaces:
      - surface: discussions
        object_types:
          - issue
    usage_hint: "[OrgName] [RepoName]"
    function: command_handler
```

To utilize this command, execute `/gh_issue OrgName RepoName` in the **Discussions** tab of the issue. Within the function logic, validations are implemented to ensure the correctness of both the organization name (`OrgName`) and repository
name (`RepoName`) before proceeding with the issue creation.

### Function logic

After creating the manifest and establishing the snap-in's logic, the next step is to define the function logic that handles the business logic. Once you understand the payload structure of a command, you can proceed with its implementation.

To proceed, define the handler function for command events.

```ts
const handleEvent = async (event: any) => {
  // Function logic goes here.
};
```

Within this handler, the initial step involves extracting the GitHub token provided as input in the keyring. Subsequently, the [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.js), responsible for managing GitHub API requests, is initialized:

```ts
const githubPAT = event.input_data.keyrings.github_connection;
const octokit = new Octokit({
  auth: githubPAT,
});
```

To facilitate authentication for DevRev API calls, a DevRev token is required.
The initialization process for the DevRev SDK involves using the received endpoint.

```ts
const devrevToken = event.context.secrets.service_account_token;
const endpoint = event.execution_metadata.devrev_endpoint;
const devrevSDK = client.setup({
  endpoint: endpoint,
  token: devrevToken,
});
```

With the SDKs successfully initialized, the next step is to invoke the necessary
APIs.

As a preliminary step, the required fields for creating a GitHub Issue, namely **title** and **body**, need to be extracted. These details are sourced from the issue.

To facilitate this, introduce a function defined for this specific purpose:

```ts
const getIssueDetails = async (workId: string, devrevSDK: any) => {
  try {
    // Get the issue details from the database using the workId
    const workItemResp = await devrevSDK.worksGet({
      id: workId,
    });
    const workItem = workItemResp.data.work;

    // Populate the issue details
    const issueDetails = {
      description: workItem.body,
      issueDisplayName: workItem.display_id,
      title: workItem.title,
    };
    return issueDetails;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    throw new Error("Failed to get issue details");
  }
};
```

Now, the function can be called within the handler function to obtain the necessary issue details::

```ts
const workId = event.payload.source_id;
const issueDetails = await getIssueDetails(workId, devrevSDK);
```

Following this, the next step involves parsing the parameters `Organization` and
`Repository Name` that were passed in the command:

```ts
const getOrgAndRepoNames = (paramString: string): string[] => {
  const paramList = paramString.split(" ");
  if (paramList.length !== 2) {
    throw new Error("Invalid Parameters");
  }
  const [orgName, repoName] = paramList;
  return [orgName, repoName];
};
```

The GitHub REST API (https://docs.github.com/en/rest/orgs/orgs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-an-organization) is used to confirm the specified organisation name.

```ts
const verifyOrgName = async (orgName: string, octokit: Octokit) => {
  try {
    await octokit.request("GET /orgs/{org}", {
      headers: {
        "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28",
      },
      org: orgName,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    throw new Error("Invalid Organisation Name");
  }
};
```

Similarly, the [GET Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/repos?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-repository) is used to validate whether the entered repository name is correct.

```ts
const verifyRepoName = async (
  orgName: string,
  repoName: string,
  octokit: Octokit
) => {
  try {
    await octokit.request("GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}", {
      headers: {
        "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28",
      },
      owner: orgName,
      repo: repoName,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    throw new Error("Invalid Repository Name");
  }
};
```

After completing all the necessary verifications, the [POST create issue](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/issues/issues?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-an-issue) can be invoked to create a new issue.

```ts
const createGitHubIssue = async (
  orgName: string,
  repoName: string,
  issueDetails: any,
  octokit: Octokit
) => {
  try {
    await octokit.request("POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues", {
      body: issueDetails.description,
      headers: {
        "X-GitHub-Api-Version": "2022-11-28",
      },
      owner: orgName,
      repo: repoName,
      title: "[" + issueDetails.issueDisplayName + "] " + issueDetails.title,
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
    throw new Error("Failed to create issue");
  }
};
```

The completion of functional logic is a key milestone in the process. After laying the framework, now you'll learn how to install this snap-in for your organization.

### Deploying the snap-in to your organization

Once the code has been validated, the next steps involve creating the snap-in version and subsequently creating the snap-in itself. Before installing the snap-in, it's essential to set up a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) and add it to the connections in DevRev as a snap-in secret. Ensure that the secret is shared within the organization so that the snap-in can utilize it.

Follow these steps to install the snap-in in your organization:

#### Step 1: Create a GitHub personal access token

Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) by following the steps outlined in the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

#### Step 2: Add PAT to DevRev connections

Add the generated PAT as a snap-in secret in DevRev. This secret is used during the installation of the snap-in. Ensure that the secret is shared within the organization to allow the snap-in to access it.

#### Step 3: Install the snap-in

During the installation of the snap-in, utilize the shared secret to authenticate and connect with GitHub. This ensures that the snap-in has the necessary permissions to interact with GitHub APIs.
