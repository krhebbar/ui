## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll learn to create a dynamic snap-in that responds to both DevRev Webhook events triggered by the creation of a [work](https://docs.devrev.ai/product/core) and specialized [command](/snapin-development/references/commands) within DevRev. 

The focus is on the process of working with the payload associated with these events. The objective is to adeptly extract pertinent fields from the payload within the defined functions, subsequently executing a well-defined action. This action involves the addition of a comment to the object timeline, a feature that can be conveniently customized.

## Background context

1. **Webhook event handling**: Understand the intricacies of responding to a
   DevRev webhook event, specifically focused on work creation.

2. **Command-based activation**: Explore how the snap-in can be triggered by a
   dedicated command within the DevRev environment.

3. **Payload exploration**: Delve into the payload structure, gaining insights
   into how to efficiently extract essential fields from within the functions.

4. **Action execution**: Become proficient in executing a specified action - adding
   a customizable comment to the object timeline.

<Steps>

### Installation guide

- Install [DevRev CLI](/snapin-development/references/cli-install)
- Install [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq)
- Install [DevRev SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devrev/typescript-sdk?activeTab=readme)

<Callout intent="info">
If you did not follow the [getting started](/snapin-development/tutorials/getting-started) tutorial then follow these steps to authenticate and initialize the snap-in TypeScript template:

```bash
devrev profiles authenticate -o <dev-org-slug> -u <youremail@yourdomain.com>
```

```bash
devrev snap_in_version init
```
</Callout>

#### Trigger

To invoke the snap-in, two distinct triggers are implemented:

1. **Creation of work item**: This trigger is activated when new objects of type
   **Issue** or **Ticket** are created in DevRev.

2. **Text command**: This manual trigger is achieved by utilizing a slash
   command in the **Discussions** tab of the objects that support this feature.

#### Action

To implement the desired action of adding a comment to the object timeline, it
is essential to identify the appropriate [API]
for this task. In this scenario, the `/timeline-entries.create` API is the
designated choice for executing the action of adding a text comment from the
snap-in. To accomplish this task, the DevRev SDK is employed.

### Creating the snap-in

#### Updating the manifest

The next step involves updating the manifest to define key attributes of
the snap-in. This includes deciding on the name and providing a descriptive
overview that is visible to users, offering context about the snap-in's
purpose.

```yml
version: "2"

name: Sample snap-in
description: Snap-in to add comments for demonstration purpose.

service_account:
  display_name: "DevRev Bot"
```

### Event source

Following the manifest update, the next step is to incorporate the [event source](/snapin-development/references/event-sources).
For this scenario, events from DevRev are essential. Therefore, an event source
of type `devrev-webhook` is added. In the configuration, the event type is
specified as `work_created`.

```yml
event_sources:
  organization:
    - name: devrev-webhook
      display_name: DevRev
      type: devrev-webhook
      config:
        event_types:
          - work_created
```

### Input fields

To enable users to configure specific comments, input fields must be defined.
For our use case, the following input fields are specified:

1. **Input field**: This text field empowers users to input a custom message to
   be added as a comment. The default value is set to "Message from the input
   field."

2. **Should extra comment be added?**: This boolean field determines whether an
   additional comment should be included. The default value is set to true.

3. **List of extra names**: This array field allows users to provide a list of
   names to be added as comments. The default value is set to ["name1",
   "name2"].

By incorporating these input fields, the snap-in becomes more adaptable and
user-friendly, enabling users to supply specific comments tailored to their
needs.

```yml
inputs:
  organization:
    - name: input_field_1
      description: Input field to add comment to the work item.
      field_type: text
      default_value: "Message from the input field."
      ui:
        display_name: Input Field 1

    - name: input_field_2
      description: Add extra comment.
      field_type: bool
      default_value: true
      ui:
        display_name: Should extra comment be added?

    - name: input_field_array
      description: List of names to add as comment.
      base_type: text
      field_type: array
      default_value: ["name1", "name2"]
      ui:
        display_name: List of extra names!
```

### Functions

With the groundwork laid out, the next crucial step involves defining the
functions responsible for handling the logic in TypeScript to add comments using
the DevRev SDK. The actual implementation of these functions is added in
the subsequent step.

```yml
functions:
  - name: function_1
    description:
      Function to create a timeline entry comment on a DevRev work item created.
  - name: function_2
    description:
      Function to create a timeline entry comment on a DevRev work item on which
      comment is added.
```

### Automations

With the building blocks in place, the final piece of the puzzle involves
defining automations. These automations encapsulate a trigger and a
corresponding function that executes when an event of a specified type occurs.

```yml
automations:
  - name: convergence_automation_devrev
    source: devrev-webhook
    event_types:
      - work_created
    function: function_1
```

### Commands

To accommodate the additional trigger, a [command](/snapin-development/references/commands) must be defined within the
manifest file:

```yml
commands:
  - name: comment_here
    namespace: devrev
    description: Command to trigger function to add comment to this work item.
    surfaces:
      - surface: discussions
        object_types:
          - issue
          - ticket
    usage_hint: "Command to add comment to this work item."
    function: function_2
```

### Function logic

Having established the architectural framework for the snap-in, identified its
triggers, and outlined the overall workflow, the next crucial phase involves
crafting the functions - `function_1` and `function_2`. These functions serve as
the engines driving the business logic behind the snap-in's behavior.

### Getting the payload

To kickstart the implementation process, understanding the structure of the
payload is paramount. Whether dealing with a work creation event or a command
event, having insight into the payload's composition is crucial. In scenarios
where the payload structure is known, implementation can proceed seamlessly.
However, if the payload structure is uncertain or real data exploration is
desired, logging the entire payload becomes an invaluable step.

To achieve this, the following code snippet can be added to the `index.ts` file:

```ts
export const run = async (events: any[]) => {
  console.info("events", JSON.stringify(events));
};
export default run;
```

### Handling DevRev event

Having gained clarity on the expected payload structure, the next step involves
crafting custom code to handle the incoming events. In this context, the
objective is to print information based on the event type. The provided
TypeScript snippet exemplifies a function, `handleEvent`, tailored for our use
case.

```ts
async function handleDevRevEvent(event: any) {
  // Extracting necessary credentials and configurations from the event context
  const devrevPAT = event.context.secrets.service_account_token;
  const API_BASE = event.execution_metadata.devrev_endpoint;

  // Setting up the DevRev SDK client
  const devrevSDK = client.setup({
    endpoint: API_BASE,
    token: devrevPAT,
  });

  // Extracting relevant information from the event payload
  const workCreated = event.payload.work_created.work;

  // Retrieving the comment input provided by the user
  const messageInput = event.input_data.global_values.input_field_1;

  // Building the initial comment body
  let bodyComment =
    "Hello World is printed on the work " +
    workCreated.display_id +
    " from the automation, with message: " +
    messageInput;

  // Checking if additional comments are requested
  const extraComment = event.input_data.global_values.input_field_2;
  const extraComments = event.input_data.global_values.input_field_array;

  // Appending extra comments to the body if requested
  if (extraComment) {
    for (let comment of extraComments) {
      bodyComment = bodyComment + " " + comment;
    }
  }

  // Creating the timeline entry comment using DevRev SDK
  const body = {
    object: workCreated.id,
    type: "timeline_comment",
    body: bodyComment,
  };
  const response = await devrevSDK.timelineEntriesCreate(body as any);

  // Returning the response from the DevRev SDK
  return response;
}
```

This function illustrates the process of handling events, extracting necessary
information from the payload, and utilizing the DevRev SDK to create a timeline
entry comment. It serves as a foundational template that can be adapted based on
specific use cases and requirements.

### Handling command event

For scenarios where a command event is triggered, a dedicated function,
`handleCommandEvent`, can be implemented to handle the event appropriately. The
provided TypeScript snippet outlines the structure of this function,
demonstrating how to extract relevant information from the event payload and
utilize the DevRev SDK to create a timeline entry comment.

```ts
async function handleCommandEvent(event: any) {
  // Extracting necessary credentials and configurations from the event context
  const devrevPAT = event.context.secrets.service_account_token;
  const API_BASE = event.execution_metadata.devrev_endpoint;

  // Setting up the DevRev SDK client
  const devrevSDK = client.setup({
    endpoint: API_BASE,
    token: devrevPAT,
  });

  // Extracting relevant information from the event payload
  const workCreated = event.payload.source_id;

  // Building the comment body for command events
  const bodyComment = "Hello World is printed on the work from the command.";

  // Creating the timeline entry comment using DevRev SDK
  const body = {
    object: workCreated,
    type: "timeline_comment",
    body: bodyComment,
  };

  // Sending the request to create the timeline entry comment
  const response = await devrevSDK.timelineEntriesCreate(body as any);

  // Returning the response from the DevRev SDK
  return response;
}
```

### Deploying the snap-in to your organization

Upon completing and validating the code changes, the next crucial step is
deploying the snap-in to your organization. Follow these steps for a seamless
deployment:

1. Navigate to the `code` folder in your project directory.

2. Execute the following commands in sequence to build, package, and create the
   necessary artifacts:
