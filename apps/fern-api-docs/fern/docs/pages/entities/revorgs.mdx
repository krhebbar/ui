`rev-orgs` endpoint

ℹ️ Workspaces (or rev orgs) are the organizations that your customers belong to. A workspace offers more granularity than accounts to define the instances of your product. Users can be mapped to track usage per workspace.

📌 For more information about workspaces, refer to [Customers](https://docs.devrev.ai/product/customers).
