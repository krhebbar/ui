`webhooks` endpoint

‚ÑπÔ∏è Webhooks enable building custom workflows in response to events on the DevRev platform. A webhook can be thought of as a 'reverse API' that's driven by events rather than requests. While APIs are used to pull data from the system, webhooks are a mechanism for the system to push data to a pre-configured endpoint. Webhooks allow you to receive notifications based on events without having to explicitly make a request.
