# Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: Support chat won't show.
  **Solution**: Ensure you have correctly called one of the identification methods: `DevRev.identifyUnverifiedUser(...)`, `DevRev.identifyVerifiedUser(...)`, or `DevRev.identifyAnonymousUser(...)`.

- **Issue**: Not receiving push notifications.
  **Solution**: Ensure that your app is configured to receive push notifications and that your device is registered with the DevRev SDK.
