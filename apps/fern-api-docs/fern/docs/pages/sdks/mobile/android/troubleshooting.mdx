# Troubleshooting

- **Issue**: Encountering problems with DevRev SDK integration.  
  **Solution**: Verify the correct SDK dependency setup in the project. Ensure `mavenCentral` is accessible from the IDE.

- **Issue**: The `showSupport()` function or XML button is unresponsive.  
  **Solution**: Confirm that user identification is performed before using the `showSupport()` function or XML button.

- **Issue**: Incorrect operation due to `App ID` and `secret` misconfiguration.  
  **Solution**: Double-check that both `App ID` and `secret` values are accurately configured in your application.
