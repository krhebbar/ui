The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that enables large language models to interact with applications through standardized interfaces.

Chef-cli provides MCP integration through the `chef-cli mcp initial-mapping` subcommand. 
This integration allows AI assistants to programmatically edit and test initial domain mapping files.

## Limitations

<Warning>
MCP integration is experimental. Functionality may vary across different AI models and MCP clients.
</Warning>

Testing shows good results with Cursor and Claude Code. The AI can prepare initial mappings with significant autonomy, though developer oversight remains essential.

## Prerequisites

- Chef-cli installed and configured
- MCP-compatible client (Cursor, Claude Code, etc.)
- External domain metadata file
- Empty or partially populated initial domain mapping file

## Configuration

Create a `.mcp.json` file with the following content:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "airdrop": {
            "command": "chef-cli",
            "args": [
                "mcp initial-mapping"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Cursor setup

1. Provide `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root.
2. Using the editor Agent mode point the AI to the initial domain mapping file.
3. Use the editor to guide the AI to create the initial domain mappings.
4. Use `initial-mapping check` to test the initial domain mappings against the local domain metadata file.

### Claude Code setup

1. Provide `.mcp.json` in your project root.
2. Using the editor point the AI to the initial domain mapping file.
3. Use the editor to guide the AI to create the initial domain mappings.
4. Use `initial-mapping check` to test the initial domain mappings against the local domain metadata file.

### Other IDEs

You can use the same `.mcp.json` file in other IDEs that support MCP.

## Usage guidelines

To guide the AI tool, provide the following instructions to your AI assistant:

```markdown
When asked to perform airdrop initial mapping:

- Refer to the `metadata.json` for the external domain metadata.
- Use `mappings.json` as your initial domain mapping file.
- Call 'use_mapping' to test out how the initial mapping behaves on the current metadata
- Use MCP tools to manipulate the initial mapping when adding and removing record type mappings, or unmapping fields or mapping simple fields. 
    For more complex field mappings you may edit the mapping file directly. 
    Refer to the `initial_mappings_schema.yaml` for its proper format.
    - If doing so, always use 'use_mapping' to verify the mapping file is still valid.
```

Adjust file paths according to your project structure.

## Available operations

The MCP server provides tools for:

- Testing mappings against metadata
- Adding and removing record type mappings
- Field mapping and unmapping operations
- Validation of mapping file structure
- Testing initial domain mapping files against local metadata files
