DevRev uses the concept of permissions to control access to records. 
Permissions are associated with users or groups and define the level of access they have to leaf types and their fields.
You can read more about permissions in the [access control documentation](https://devrev.ai/docs/product/access-control).

## Groups

To make groups available in the DevRev platform, Airdrop expects two objects:

1. An object containing descriptions of groups available in the external system.
  - Maps to the `group` object in DevRev.
2. An object containing a mapping between groups and users in the external system.
  - Maps to the `object_member` object in DevRev.

### Group memberships

An object containing the mapping between groups and users in the external system is required to represent group memberships in DevRev.

- This object maps to the `object_member` object in DevRev.
- It should contain a field that references a group. 
This field should be mapped to `object_id` field of the `object_member` object.
- It should also contain a collection field that references the users belonging to that group. 
This field should be mapped to the `add_member_ids` field.
- If the external system supports event-based updates for group membership changes, the `object_member` object should include an additional collection field.
This field identifies users to be removed from the group and should be mapped to the `remove_member_ids` field.

## Platform groups

Platform groups are automatically created by the DevRev platform for every organization. 
For example, DevRev provides *Dev users* and *Rev users* groups that contain all Dev and Rev users respectively.

Developers and end-users can map external default groups to platform groups. 
This functionality allows flexible integration with DevRev's permission system while enabling re-mapping by the end user.

To implement this mapping:
1. Define a new object in external domain metadata with one enum field containing possible values of default groups available in the external system. 
2. During initial domain mapping, map this object to the *platform groups* object in DevRev.
3. Reference your object in other fields, such as in the `shared_with` field of articles.

## Shared with field

The `shared_with` field enables you to define permissions for articles (and other objects in the future). 
It specifies both who can access the content and what permission level they have. 
This field utilizes the `permission` type to associate users or groups with their designated roles.

### Structure

Each entry in the `shared_with` collection contains two key components:

- `member_id`: Identifies which user or group is being granted access.
- `role`: Specifies the permission level (for example, "viewer", "editor", "owner"). DevRev offers a set of predefined roles.

### Member types

The `member_id` field can reference three different types of objects:
- Individual users (`#record:users`)
- Standard groups (`#record:groups`)
- Platform groups (`#record:platform_groups`)

### External metadata example

```json
{
  "shared_with": {
    "type": "permission",
    "collection": {},
    "permission": {
      "role": {
        "values": [
          {
            "key": "owner",
            "name": "Owner"
          },
          {
            "key": "editor",
            "name": "Editor"
          },
          {
            "key": "viewer",
            "name": "Viewer"
          }
        ]
      },
      "member_id": {
        "refers_to": {
          "#record:users": {},
          "#record:groups": {},
          "#record:platform_groups": {}
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Article permissions

Articles in DevRev can be shared with individual users or groups, allowing for granular control over who can access what content.

### Sharing mechanism

The `shared_with` field specifies the permission level for each user or group using the `permission` type.
This type is a structure that connects a reference to a user-like record type (the `member_id` field)
with an `enum` value that defines the user's role or permission level.

### Scope interaction

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Internal scope">

For `scope=internal` articles:
- By default, only the owner has access.
- Additional access is granted exclusively through the `shared_with` field.
</Tab>

<Tab title="External scope">

For `scope=external` articles, the expected behavior is that they are published to Portal/PLuG and shared with customers.

- By default:
  - Admins have CRUD (create, read, update, delete) rights.
  - Platform users have CRU (create, read, update) rights.
- Additional rights can be assigned by creating roles and assigning them to the entire organization or specific groups.
- Articles can be shared with customers and published to Portal/PLuG.
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Authorization policy

The *Authorization policy* object translates permission structures from an external system into DevRev's access control model. 
It enables the import of external roles and their associated permissions, automatically creating corresponding roles, role sets, and access control entries (ACEs) within DevRev. 
This allows defining CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) permissions for specific record types, applying them to users and groups.

<Info>
Only 1-way sync (from the external system to DevRev) is supported for authorization policy.
</Info>

### Object fields

The Authorization policy object supports the following fields:

- `groups` (optional): A list of group identifiers from the external system to which this policy applies.
- `users` (optional): A list of user identifiers from the external system to which this policy applies.
- `targets`: Defines the DevRev record types the permissions apply to. It uses the `type_key` type. The format differs between metadata definition and runtime import.
- `privileges`: Specifies the permissions granted by the policy. These should be normalized to CRUD operations.

### External domain metadata

To define the `targets` field in the external domain metadata use the `type_key` type to specify a list of strings representing the record types or record type categories the policy applies to.
- Use the prefix `#record:` for specific record types (for example, `#record:document`).
- Use the prefix `#category:` for record type categories (for example, `#category:users`).

Example:
```json
["#record:document", "#category:users"]
```

To define the `privileges` field in the external domain metadata, specify an `enum` field representing the distinct permission levels available in the external system. 
Normalize these external permissions to their closest CRUD equivalents (create, read, update, delete).

During initial domain mapping, you map these enum values to DevRev's standard CRUD permissions. End users can later customize this mapping if needed.

<Warning>
Authorization policies should always represent the current state of the external system. In each sync run, the entire policy should be recreated or not provided at all.

The object must be marked as `is_snapshot` to indicate it represents the current state of the external system.
</Warning>

### Runtime import

The `targets` field is an array of strings containing the actual DevRev record type names. 
If a category was specified in the metadata (for example, `#category:users`), it should be expanded into the list of all record types belonging to that category at runtime.

For example, if the `#category:users` includes "executives" and "developers", the runtime targets field should be:
```json
["document", "executives", "developers"]
```

The `privileges` field is an array of strings representing the specific CRUD permissions granted by the policy, based on the mapping defined during domain setup (or as re-mapped by the user).

For example, if the external role granted read and update access, the runtime privileges field should be:
```json
["read", "update"]
```
