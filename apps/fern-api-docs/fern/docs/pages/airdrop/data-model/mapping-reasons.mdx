Airdrop uses transformation methods to map data from one data model to another. 
These methods operate at the individual field level, transforming data field-by-field rather than entire records at once. 
Each transformation method has specific requirements regarding the field types and data formats it can work with. 
If the source data field does not meet these requirements for a particular transformation method, that mapping option is not available for selection during the mapping configuration process.

There are several reasons why some mappings might be unavailable:

1. A common reason is mismatch of types. For example, if a DevRev field is expected to be `rich_text`, 
but the field is set as `text` mapping to some fields is unavailable. 
Refer to the [supported types](../metadata-extraction.mdx#declare-fields-for-each-record-type) 
section and the general DevRev documentation for more information.
2. Only references can be mapped to references. Ensure that source system fields are correctly 
mapped to reference fields in DevRev.
3. Support for the `struct` type is limited. Marking a field as a struct in the metadata schema will 
make it unavailable for mapping outside of using the custom jq transformation method. 
Refer to the [metadata tips](../faq.mdx#metadata-extraction) for more information.
4. Links are supported only on works and conversations.

## Transformation methods
The following tables outline the available transformation methods categorized by their applicable field types:

### Custom fields transformation methods

| Method | Description | Requirements |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `make_constrained_simple_value` | Propagates validation constraints from the external system and enforces those in DevRev | - |
| `make_enum` | Produces an enum field | External field must be of type enum |
| `make_uenum` | Produces an enum field | External field must be of type enum |
| `reference_custom_field` | Produces a reference field | External field must be of type reference |

### Metadata extraction transformation methods

| Method | Description | Requirements |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `make_custom_stages` | Makes custom stages | Requires stage diagram data in the domain metadata |
| `map_enum` | Produces an enum field | External field must be of type enum |
| `map_roles` | Maps permission roles from external to DevRev format | - |
| `use_as_array_value` | Produces an array field | External field must be a scalar (single-value) |
| `use_devrev_record` | Enables use of a fixed reference to something in DevRev | DON should be of the right type |
| `use_directly` | Identity operator that returns exactly the input | External field must be of the same type as the DevRev field; if external field is an array, internal field must also be an array |
| `use_fixed_value` | Produces a fixed value in DevRev | Only available for boolean or enum DevRev fields |

### Custom and stock fields transformation methods

| Method | Description | Requirements |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `use_rich_text` | Produces a rich text field | External field must be of type `rich_text` |

### Constructed custom fields transformation methods

| Method | Description | Requirements |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `construct_text_field` | Produces a text field | External field must be of type text |

### Universal transformation method

| Method | Description | Requirements |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| `use_raw_jq` | Enables the use of `jq` to transform data | Can be used on all fields, but should be used sparingly, only if no other transformation method is available |
