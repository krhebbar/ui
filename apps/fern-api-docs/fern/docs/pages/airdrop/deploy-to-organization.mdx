Once you're ready to test your snap-in in a production environment, you can deploy the snap-in to your organization.

Follow these steps:

1. Copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env` and fill in the required variables.
2. Deploy a draft version of your snap-in to your organization by using `make deploy`.
3. Install the snap-in in your DevRev by going to **Settings** > **Snap-ins** > **Install snap-in**.
4. Set up the connection under **Settings** > **Airdrops** > **Connections**.
5. Create an import at **Settings** > **Airdrops** > **Airdrop**.

This step is also a prerequisite for publishing the snap-in on the DevRev marketplace.

### Observability

To observe logs from your snap-in in your development environment:

```bash
devrev snap_in_package logs | jq
```

To open logs in your favorite editor:

```bash
devrev snap_in_package logs | code -
```
