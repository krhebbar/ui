The starter Airdrop snap-in template is available [here](https://github.com/devrev/airdrop-template).

Starting with the template is recommended, as it includes all the necessary boilerplate and structure for a new project.

The template makes use of **[DevRev's SDK library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@devrev/ts-adaas)**,
which provides abstraction over the DevRevâ€™s Airdrop control protocol.
The SDK simplifies the workflow for data extraction and loading, handling events,
state management, and artifacts (batches of extracted items).

It provides features such as:

- **Event management**: Communication between Airdrop platform and Airdrop snap-in involves messages called
  _events_ - depending on the type of event, the snap-in performs different actions.
- **State handling**: Update and access state in real-time within tasks.
- **Artifact management**: Supports batched storage of artifacts.
- **Error & timeout support**: Error handling and timeout management for long-running tasks.
- **Type definitions**: Structured types for Airdrop control protocol.

### Snap-in code structure

If you check the template, you can see that a snap-in is a Node.js project with a specific file structure:

```yaml
- manifest.yaml
- code/
  - scripts/
  - src/
    - fixtures/
    - functions/
      - external-system/
      - extraction/
        - workers/
          - attachments-extraction.ts
          - data-extraction.ts
          - external-sync-units-extraction.ts
          - metadata-extraction.ts
        - index.ts
      - loading/
        - workers/
          - load-attachments.ts
          - load-data.ts
        - index.ts
    - test-runner/
  - test/
```

The `manifest.yaml` is a configuration file that defines details such as the snap-in's name, description, version, connection information, and functionality specifics. Adjusting this file is the initial step in the development of a snap-in.

The `code/` folder holds the implementation of the snap-in. Inside, the `functions/` subfolder includes the logic for retrieving external sync units, extracting data from and loading data to external systems, and mapping between them.
