During the deletion phases, the snap-in may clean up its state or other side effects in the third
party systems. In the most common extraction use cases, there is nothing to do and snap-ins may reply
with the completion message.

## Data deletion

### Triggering event

Airdrop initiates the data deletion phase when the import is deleted in the DevRev app.
It is started by sending the worker a message with an event of type `EXTRACTION_DATA_DELETE`.

### Response from the snap-in

The worker must respond to Airdrop with a message with an event of type `EXTRACTION_DATA_DELETE_DONE`
when done or `EXTRACTION_DATA_DELETE_ERROR` in case of an error.

## Attachments deletion


### Triggering event

Airdrop initiates the attachments deletion phase when an import is deleted from the DevRev app,
after the data deletion has completed.
It is started by sending the snap-in a message with an event of type `EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_DELETE`.

### Response from the snap-in

The snap-in must respond to Airdrop with a message with an event of type`EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_DELETE_DONE`
when done, or `EXTRACTION_ATTACHMENTS_DELETE_ERROR` in case of an error.
