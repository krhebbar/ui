Before starting snap-in development, it's important to understand these fundamental terms and concepts,
as well as the capabilities and limitations of the external system being integrated.

## DevRev organization

If this is your first time setting up an organization within DevRev, you need to create a
DevRev organization for developing your new Airdrop snap-in:

1. Click on your profile picture in the top left corner.
2. Go to the **Orgs** section and click on **+**.
3. Fill in the necessary details and click **Create**.

You now find your newly created organization under **Orgs**.

## External system

Before starting the development of a snap-in for integration with an external system API,
consider gathering the following information:

- **API documentation**: Obtain the official API documentation of the external system.
  This is the primary source of information about how to connect and interact with the system.
- **Authentication and authorization**: Understand the authentication and authorization
  methods required. This may include API keys, OAuth tokens, or other security mechanisms.
- **Endpoints and resources**: Identify the required API endpoints and resources. Understand
  their functions, input parameters, expected outputs, and usage limitations.
- **Data format**: Determine the data format used by the API, such as JSON or XML. This helps
  in parsing responses and formatting requests appropriately.
- **Rate limits and quotas**: Be aware of any rate limits or usage quotas. This information is
  crucial to ensure that the integration does not exceed allowed requests or data usage.
- **Error handling**: Learn about error response formats and codes. Knowing this helps in
  handling errors and exceptions in your integration.

## Basic concepts

### Sync unit

A _sync unit_ is one self-encompassing unit of data that is synced to an external system. For example:
- A project in Jira.
- An account in SalesForce.
- An organization Zendesk.

In Jira, users often have multiple projects. Each project acts as an individual sync unit. 
In contrast, Zendesk operates with a single large pool of tickets and agents. Here, the entire Zendesk instance can be synced in a single airdrop.

### Sync run

Airdrop extractions are done in _sync runs_.
A sync run is one end-to-end (extract-transform-load) execution of a _sync unit_.
If you do an initial import from the external system to DevRev, that import will be one sync run.
Another import in the same direction is another sync run.
And if you then decide to do a reverse sync from DevRev to the external system, that would be another
sync run.

Each sync run is comprised out of phases.
Phases follow sequentially, and each can consist of one or more invocations of the snap-in.

### Forward sync

A _forward sync_ is a sync run from an external system to DevRev.
An **extractor** function in the snap-in is responsible for extracting data from the external system.

### Reverse sync

A _reverse sync_ is a sync run from DevRev to an external system.
It uses a **loader** function, to create or update data in the external system.

### Initial sync

The first sync is called the _initial sync_.
It is triggered manually by the end user in DevRev's **Airdrops** UI.

During the initial sync, all data from the external sync unit is extracted from the external system and loaded into DevRev. 
This process typically involves a large import and may take some time.

An _initial import_ consists of the following phases:

1. External sync units extraction
2. Metadata extraction
3. Data extraction
4. Attachments extraction

### 1-way (incremental sync)

A _1-way sync_ (or _incremental sync_) refers to any extraction after the initial sync run has been successfully completed.

An extractor extracts data that was created or updated in the external system after the start
of the latest successful forward sync.
This includes any changes that happened after the start of the previous sync, but were not picked up by it.

A 1-way sync consists of the following phases:

1. Metadata extraction
2. Data extraction
3. Attachments extraction

### 2-way sync

A _2-way sync_ is a reverse sync.
The loader receives information about changes in DevRev since the last successful reverse sync and updates the data in the external system.

A 2-way sync consists of the following phases:

1. Data loading
2. Attachments loading
