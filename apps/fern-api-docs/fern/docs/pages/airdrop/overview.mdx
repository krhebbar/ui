_Airdrop_ is DevRev’s solution for migrating data between DevRev and an external system. 
It allows our users to import their existing data from an external system,
export any changes in DevRev back to the external system, and keep data in sync.

DevRev provides a range of snap-ins available through the DevRev marketplace for integration with
various external systems like Jira and Zendesk.
These DevRev provided snap-ins are also called _native snap-ins_.

Sometimes, a specific native snap-in may not be available for a given external system. 
This is why DevRev enables creation of external snap-ins by third-party developers,
allowing them to integrate with DevRev’s Airdrop and develop their own Airdrop snap-ins. 
These community-developed snap-ins can offer the same functionality as native snap-ins.

You can learn more about Airdrop in the [general documentation](https://docs.devrev.ai/import#airdrop-features).
