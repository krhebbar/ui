<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Getting a *Conflict* error when running `make deploy`">
    A snap-in package with the same slug already exists.
    Override the `SNAP_IN_SLUG` variable by explicitly updating the variable in `scripts/vars.sh`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Deployment of snap-in failed after *Waiting for snap-in version to be ready* message">
    The snap-in version could not be built.
    Check the logs by running the DevRev CLI command. For prettier UI, pipe the output to `jq`.
    ```bash
    devrev snap_in_package logs | jq
    ```

## Token handling
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="*Token is expired* when deploying or cleaning up">
    Authentication token to the `DEV_ORG` has expired. Reauthenticate the organization by running:
    ```bash
    make auth
    ```

## Metadata extraction
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tips for defining record types">
    The main purpose of metadata is to define record types. 
    Each record type should correspond to a homogeneous set of records in the external system: a domain object that has a well-defined schema.

    In some cases, this means simply declaring one record type for API endpoints like `/comments` of the external system,
    but in other cases, external systems can have configurable custom types or subtypes (for example, issue types in Jira).
    In these cases, the snap-in will need to query an API for the list of types and produce a dynamic list of record types in the metadata.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Understanding record type categories">
    Record types don't have hierarchy; each is a leaf type corresponding to concrete records in files marked with that itemtype. 
    Record type categories can be used to group them, serving two purposes:

    1. To define mapping rules that apply to a dynamic set of record types, unknown at the time the snap-in is created.
    2. To tell the recipe system that a record can transition between two record types while preserving its identity.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Working with integer fields">
    The field type `int` is used to represent integer numeric values. 
    In certain external systems, identifiers of records or enum values are also stored as integers. 
    These are, however, not *conceptually integers* in Airdrop's perspective.
    
    The natural format of integers is `null` | JSON numbers without decimals.
    Numbers encoded to strings (e.g., `"2112"`), or empty strings should not be used.
  </Accordion>
    
  <Accordion title="Working with collections">
    All logical data types can be modified to be a collection instead.
    The natural format of a collection is a JSON array (or `null`), containing the natural format of its elements. 
    For example:

    ```json
    {
      "reporter_ids": [
        {
          "ref_type": "user",
          "id": "2103232131",
          "fallback_record_name": "John Doe"
        },
        {
          "ref_type": "contact",
          "id": "2103232144",
          "fallback_record_name": "Jane Doe"
        }
      ],
      "tags": ["bug", "good-first-issue"]
    }
    ```

    Some systems provide collections as enum values or references in a string, separated by some separator (comma or semicolon):

    ```json
    {
      "reporter_ids": "2103232131,2103232144",
      "tags": "bug;good-first-issue"
    }
    ```

    This format should be avoided, and the data normalized to the natural format in the extractor.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Using struct fields">
    Structs are embedded JSON objects inside a given field. 
    They represent data that consists of multiple elements belonging together (like a phone number or address) but doesn't form its own record with identity.
    
    These are helpful when the whole struct is optional/nullable, but some of its fields are required, providing a cleaner representation than flattening it. 
    Example:

    ```json
    {
      "address": {
        "country": "US",
        "state": "TX",
        "city": "Austin",
        "address_line": "Rocket Road 1"
      },
      "phone_number": null
    }
    ```

    Many systems resolve references to embedded structs:

    ```json
    {
      "creator": {
        "userId": "2103232144",
        "name": "Jane Doe",
        "role": "Adventurer",
        "email": "jane@doe.com"
      }
    }
    ```

    Such detailed references should not be declared as structs in Airdrop. 
    They should be transformed to either a simple ID reference or a dynamically typed reference with exactly the fields `id`, `fallback_record_name`, and `ref_type`. 
    Using references and structs inside structs is currently not supported.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Custom fields">
    Any field in the metadata not otherwise mapped is offered to the end user as a custom field, with no additional effort needed.
