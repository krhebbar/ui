Loading is the process of exporting data from DevRev back to the external system.
This process includes creating new items in the external system and updating them with any changes made in DevRev.

The snap-in manages two phases for loading:
* Load data
* Load attachments

Each phase is defined in a separate file and is responsible for loading the corresponding data.

```typescript
import { AirdropEvent, EventType, spawn } from '@devrev/ts-adaas';

export interface LoaderState {}

export const initialLoaderState: LoaderState = {};

function getWorkerPerLoadingPhase(event: AirdropEvent) {
  let path;
  switch (event.payload.event_type) {
    case EventType.StartLoadingData:
    case EventType.ContinueLoadingData:
      path = __dirname + '/workers/load-data';
      break;
    case EventType.StartLoadingAttachments:
    case EventType.ContinueLoadingAttachments:
      path = __dirname + '/workers/load-attachments';
      break;
  }
  return path;
}

const run = async (events: AirdropEvent[]) => {
  for (const event of events) {
    const file = getWorkerPerLoadingPhase(event);
    await spawn<LoaderState>({
      event,
      initialState: initialLoaderState,
      workerPath: file,
      initialDomainMapping: {
        /* your initial domain mapping JSON here */
      },
      // options: {},
    });
  }
};

export default run;
```

<Note>
  You must pass the <code>initialDomainMapping</code> parameter to{" "}
  <code>spawn</code> when running loading phases. This ensures the correct
  domain mapping is installed and used by the snap-in.
</Note>

## State handling

Loading phases run as separate runtime instances, similar to extraction phases, with a maximum execution time of 13 minutes. 
These phases share a `state`, defined in the `LoaderState` interface. 
It is important to note that the loader state is separate from the extractor state. 

Access to the `state` is available through the SDK's `adapter` object.

## Creating items in DevRev

To create an item in DevRev and sync it with the external system, start by creating an item with a **subtype** that was established during the initial sync. After selecting the subtype, fill out the necessary details for the item.
