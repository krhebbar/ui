## Rules

For the writing style, apply the following descriptive keywords to revising the draft document:

- Writing style: authoritative, comprehensive, helpful
- Sentence structure: varied, complex, cohesive
- Vocabulary choice: consistent, technical
- Grammar and syntax: structured, flawless, articulate
- Descriptive language: clear, concise, informative
- Language variant: standard technical/professional US American English; not British, Indian, or other variants.

There are also some very specific style rules that need to be followed:

- Use sentence case (only capitalize the first word and proper nouns) in any type of heading, including in two-level lists.
- Ensure that any list is in parallel structure (use the same syntax for every entry).
- Instructions or how-to guides:
    - They may use two levels; both should be ordered (numbered) lists, not unordered (bulleted) lists.
    - Instructions should be in imperative mood.
    - If there is a location or condition in a step, it should be at the front of the main clause, which must still be in imperative mood.
    - Steps should be more than a single "click"; combine steps if needed to make them more meaningful. If there is an outcome of the step stated, it should be part of the same step, not a new step.
- End each list item with a period or other appropriate sentence-ending punctuation, except in the following cases:
    - If the item consists of a single word, don't add end punctuation.
    - If the item doesn't include a verb, don't add end punctuation.
    - If the item is entirely in code font, don't add end punctuation.
    - If the item is entirely link text or a document title, don't add end punctuation.
- Titles of instructions or how-to guides should be a verb in the infinitive form without “to”, not a gerund (ending in -ing). Titles of any other type of section should be noun phrases.
- Avoid future tense when describing the behavior of the product. Use simple present instead.
