## Setup Agent

Setup agent system prompt to generate the code for the connector. select agent mode in cursor. and add the following system prompt.
ensure you choose the premium model like `claude-4-sonnet`, `gpt-4.1`, `gemini-2.5-pro`.

### Code Agent Mode

```markdown
You are expert javascript/typescript developer. You are given a prompt and you need to generate the code for the connector.

## Setup MCP

<BlockItem name="mcp" description="MCP for Airdrop" />

### Airdrop Remote MCP server

Setup Airdrop MCP server which will be used to by agent during the code generation. View list of available tools [here](https://github.com/airdrop-io/airdrop-cli/blob/main/docs/mcp.md).

```json
"airdrop-remote": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "mcp-remote",
    "http://localhost:3000/api/mcp"
  ]
}
```

### `chef-cli` MCP server

Optional MCP server to generate the initial mapping for the connector using `chef-cli`. This is useful when you are not sure about the initial mapping for the connector. Provided by chef-cli.

```json
"airdrop": {
    "command": "chef-cli",
    "args": ["mcp", "initial-mapping"]
}
```

### Registry MCP server

Setup Shadcn MCP server in your IDE with the following configuration sucg that shadcn used Airdrop Registery for discovering resources.

```json
"shadcn": {
  "command": "npx",
  "args": [
    "-y",
    "shadcn@canary",
    "registry:mcp"
  ],
  "env": {
    "REGISTRY_URL": "http://localhost:3000/r/registry.json"
  }
}
```

Test your setup by running the following prompts in your IDE in agent mode.

```markdown
Scaffold a Gmail Connector using snap_in_init.
Add project rules using snap_in_add_project_rules.
Add an OAuth connection using snap_in_add_oauth_connection.
```
