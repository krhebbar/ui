# Airdrop snap-in template

This GitHub repository provides a template with example code to implement an Airdrop snap-in,
which imports todo lists, todos and users from a fake example external system into DevRev.

## Usage

1. Press on the green "Use this template" button, then "Create a new repository"
2. Name the repository in the form `airdrop-<external-system-name>-snap-in`, e.g
`airdrop-github-snap-in` (otherwise you will have to edit the snap-in manifest and a few other files).
3. Create the repository

A new repository will be created, with some data already populated by the template, assuming you set
the name according to Step 2 above.

## Additional info

While developing the Airdrop snap-in, make sure to refer to the
[Airdrop snap-in documentation](https://developer.devrev.ai/public/snapin-development/adaas/).
